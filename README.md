# 05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

## Description

This a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day. The events are saved to local storage so they can in turn remain on the scheduler. As the time of day passes, the event times will change color to distinguish past, present and future. This is a very helpful tool to use if you need reminders of task to complete throughout the day.
